                    Electric vehicles (EVs) have seen massive increases in
                    sales, news coverage, political importance, and regulatory
                    attention in the last decade as the worrying effects of
                    climate change due to \(CO_2\) emissions become abundantly
                    clear. Adoption of this “green” alternative to traditional
                    internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is touted as the
                    most climate-friendly option. However, there are hidden
                    costs to people and the environment in the production
                    process of the lithium-ion batteries required for EVs and
                    in the carbon emissions of the energy generation methods
                    that power EVs. In an effort to understand the full social
                    and environmental impact of the electrification of
                    transportation, we conducted an investigative data analysis
                    to determine the true cost of electric vehicles, compare EV
                    costs to the cost of ICE vehicles, and explore strategies
                    for charging consumers the true cost of their transportation
                    choices.

                    for batteries required in electric vehicles as compared to

                    While electronic devices — phones, laptops, and yes, EVs —
                    are symbols of modern technology, the rechargeable batteries
                    they rely on are built on the backs of an exploitative
                    system for labor. We first investigate the human labor and
                    mining costs of cobalt, the primary mineral used in
                    lithium-ion batteries. To determine the human costs, we will
                    look at the direct and downstream costs of labor of mineral

                    as compared to those for ICE cars.

                    The most important component of an EV is its battery and
                    cobalt is one of the three principle minerals used in the
                    manufacturing of all lithium ion rechargeable batteries.
                    60% of the world’s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic
                    of the Congo (DRC), a country in Central Africa. The DRC has
                    seen a massive boom in industrial mining in the past decade
                    as billions of dollars from multinational corporations have
                    streamed into the country as the financial profits of cobalt
                    mining became increasingly evident. Today, the majority of
                    mining companies in the DRC are Chinese, following a 2009
                    agreement signed by then-President Joseph Kabila. This deal
                    granted the Chinese government access to the country's
                    copper-cobalt mines in exchange for billions of dollars in
                    aid, loans, and infrastructure projects. As a result,
                    Chinese state-owned and state-backed companies now control
                    70% of the DRC’s mining sector [5].

                    These reports extensively document cases of worker
                    mistreatment, human rights violations, and child labor

                    We focus on the data presented in the November 2021 report
                    “The Road to Ruin? Electric Vehicles and Workers’ Rights
                    Abuses at DR Congo’s industrial cobalt mines,” written by
                    Rights and Accountability in Development (RAID), a UK-based
                    NGO “exposing corporate wrongdoing, environmental harm and
                    human rights abuse.” In partnership with Centre d’Aide
                    Juridico-Judiciaire (CAJJ), a Congolese legal aid centre
                    specialized in labor rights, this report was the result of
                    over 2 years of investigation and 130 interviews with
                    current and former workers at 5 industrial mines in the DRC [9].

                <h3>The Subcontracting Model</h3>
                <p>
                    With a focus on these five largest industrial cobalt mines
                    discussed in the RAID report, we investigate the cost of
                    paying workers in DRC a living wage. The report documents
                    that currently, many workers do not earn a living wage,
                    “have little or no health provisions, and far too often are
                    subjected to excessive working hours, unsafe working
                    conditions, degrading treatment, discrimination and racism”
                    (p 3). The exploitation of workers stems largely from the
                    subcontracting model used by multinational mining companies.
                    Instead of hiring directly, they rely on indirect hires
                    through subcontractor companies to source their labor, from
                    miners to support staff. The RAID report’s interviews with
                    workers and managers suggest this model is designed to cut
                    costs, limit liability, and restrict unionization.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    This system of subcontracted labor creates a system in which
                    the majority of workers in the DRC are not afforded a steady
                    income, benefits such as time off or health, nor protections
                    of their labor rights.

                        There are two umbrellas of types of workers,direct and
                        indirect hire. Indirectly hired workers are further
                        broken down into temporary and daily workers, with
                        further diminished rights and wages.

                    While subcontracting is standard for short-term or
                    specialized roles, evidence suggests mining companies in
                    Congo rely on it for core operations, paying extremely low
                    wages. The legal minimum wage in the DRC is 7,075 Congolese
                    Francs per day or 172,630 per month. While most directly
                    employed workers at KCC, Metalkol, Sicomines, and TFM earn
                    above a living wage, Somidez employees reported an average
                    monthly salary of just $355. However, workers hired through
                    subcontractors fare worse, earning an average of
                    $330.10—well below the $402 monthly living wage estimated
                    for the Kolwezi area, the primary location of cobalt mining
                    in the DRC. This living wage estimate by the RAID report
                    used the Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) methodology
                    developed by humanitarian agencies to assess the basic needs
                    of populations in emergencies. The MEB identifies the
                    monetary requirements to meet basic needs of a household on
                    a regular or seasonal basis and their average costs.

                        little job security, benefits, nor healthcare.

                    Using data from the RAID report, at least 26,455 workers are
                    employed at the 5 mines of interest, with 57% hired through
                    subcontractors (categorized as indirect hires) —rising to
                    68% at TFM and 64% at Metalkol in 2020. This means that more
                    than half of the workers at these mines are at the mercy of
                    the subcontracting firms to find work and “are generally
                    poorly paid, undertake physically punishing work for long
                    shifts, receive minimal healthcare coverage with limited or
                    no cover for their families (despite it being required by
                    Congolese law) and are frequently denied their entitlement
                    to paid leave” (p 26). Moreover, these workers have no
                    rights to time off and are routinely paid less than direct

                <h3>Paying a Living Wage</h3>
                <p>
                    We will now calculate the cost of paying all mining workers
                    in the DRC. In the DRC, the maximum working week is capped
                    at 45 hours, as stipulated by the Congolese Labour Code
                    (art. 119). Any work done outside these hours is considered
                    overtime and must be compensated at a higher rate. In the
                    mining sector, however, many workers, especially
                    subcontracted ones, work longer hours and are not granted
                    any form of overtime pay. For example, workers on a typical
                    “6-3” schedule—working 9am to 9pm for three days, then 4am
                    to 4pm for three days, followed by three days off—exceeding
                    the standard 45-hour week. For the purposes of our
                    calculations, we will assume subcontracted workers work 56
                    hours per week with no overtime compensation. In contrast,
                    direct hire workers will be assumed to work only 45 hours
                    per week.

                            $402 per month. Assuming they work a full 45-hour week:

                    Note that the hourly wage for indirect hires is even lower
                    than that of direct hire workers, and these workers are
                    often subjected to worse conditions, including lack of
                    healthcare, time off, and other benefits required by

                    Next, we consider the scale of cobalt production for use in

                                    The RAID report indicates that these five
                                    mines produce 59,502 tonnes (59,502,000 kg)
                                    of cobalt.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    For the entire DRC, we scale this up to reflect the total production:
                                    \[59502000\;\text{kg} \times \frac{5}{3} = 99170000\;\text{kg}\]

                                    Therefore, 99,170,000 kg of cobalt is produced annually in the DRC.

                                    A typical EV battery uses 14 kg of cobalt [1]

                                    Thus, the total number of EV batteries that could be produced from the cobalt mined in the DRC is:
                                    \[ \frac{99170000\;\text{kg}}{14\;\text{kg/EV}} = 7085714\;\text{batteries}\]

                                    Rounding, we find that the cobalt mined in the DRC produces 7,000,000 batteries. 
                                </li>

                <p class="indented">
                    Given this level of production, we now must ask how much we

                    additional cost of labor to pay all workers a living wage.

                                    There are 22,952 workers at the five mines.

                                    To scale this for all cobalt production in
                                    the DRC (since the five mines produce 61% of
                                    the cobalt), the total number of workers
                                    across all DRC cobalt mining is:
                                    \[22952 \times \frac{5}{3} = 38253 \text{miners}\quad \text{(approx. 38,000 workers)}\]

                                    The current daily wage for miners is about $3/day.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Annually, that amounts to:
                                    \[3 \, \text{USD/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks/year} = 780 \, \text{USD/year}\]

                                <li>
                                    However, the proposed living wage is $4,824/year.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The gap is:
                                    \[4,824 \, \text{USD/year} - 780 \, \text{USD/year} = 4,044 \, \text{USD/year}\]
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Therefore, each worker needs an additional $4,044 annually.
                                </li>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Total increase in spending for workers:
                            \[38,000 \, \text{workers} \times 4,044 \, \text{USD} = 154,696,480 \, \text{USD}\]
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                Distributing this cost across the 7,000,000 batteries produced
                    from cobalt mined in the DRC, we find that the additional
                    cost per battery would be:
                    \[ \frac{154,696,480 \, \text{USD}}{7,000,000 \, \text{batteries}} \approx 21.83 \, \text{USD/battery}\]
                So for an average EV with two batteries, we need to increase the
                cost of the vehicle by only roughly $44 to pay all mining workers
                fair wages.
                </p>
                <h3>Takeaways from paying a living wage</h3>
                <p>
                    To provide a living wage of $4,824/year to all the miners
                    producing cobalt in the DRC, the total increase in spending
                    for the workers would be about $154.7 million. While this
                    seems like a very large sum, given the scale of production
                    of batteries, this would increase the price of each EV by
                    approximately $43.67.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Thus, the cost of ensuring a living wage for miners
                    producing cobalt in the DRC would have a relatively small
                    effect on the final price of electric vehicles—only about
                    $43.67 per car.
                </p>
                <h3>Pollution Costs</h3>
                <p>
                    Mining for batteries also pose a deep threat for the
                    surrounding environment, which in turn affects its
                    inhabitants. Mining raw materials requires harsh chemicals
                    and large amounts of water, often in areas where water is
                    already scarce. We'll start with the carbon cost generated
                    from the mining process [8].
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Research states that the mining of minerals required
                            for a Tesla Model 3 battery is around 9,2000 kg of
                            CO2 [8].
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiply by the social cost of carbon in the U.S, 
                            around $190 per tonne:
                            \[92000 \text{kg CO2/ battery} \times 0.0478  \text{USD/ kg CO2} = $1747\,\text{per battery}\]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Then, for a car with 2 batteries, we get an increase of
                            $3494 in the cost of the EV.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    By comparison, the social cost of carbon incurred in ICE
                    manufacturing is much lower, at $1064 per vehicle.

                    The mining process poses further destruction to the nearby
                    environment. Miners need to create heat between 800 and
                    1,000C, which requires the burning of fossil fuels. This
                    hurts the local water supply and therefore affects the
                    agricultural industry nearby.  In an article in the National
                    Library of Medicine, researchers talked to farmers in the
                    Katangese Copperbelt in Central Africa, noting their
                    struggle to obtain compensation for the costs of nearby
                    mining. In this area, many farmers note the decrease in
                    water quality. Specifically, between 2013 and 2014, they
                    note the death of fish in the nearby river, and increased
                    crop failure. The polluters have not responded to these
                    concerns, however, 88% of the farmers interviewed voiced a
                    need for the depollution of their area. They further state
                    that they would accept, if offered, a compensation of $US
                    2820 per farmer [6].

                    Granted that 34% of the global cobalt supply is
                    used for EV battery production [7], and that there are 30,000
                    farmers in the DRC impacted by mineral mining, then
                    \[.34 * 2820\,\text{USD} * 300000\,\text{farmers} / 7000000\,\text{batteries} = 41 \,\text{USD/battery}\]
                    This adds an additional $82 to the cost of each EV.

                <h2>The Cost of Carbon Emissions</h2>
                <p>
                    CO2 emissions are the primary environmental concern for the
                    transportation industry. ICE vehicles have long been 
                    criticized for their high carbon emissions due to the direct
                    burning of gasoline. However, the carbon emissions of the
                    energy generation methods that power EVs are often ignored.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    In order to dig deeper into the climate impact of EVs, we
                    first assesed the current state of the energy generation
                    methods used to power EVs in the United States. Drawing on
                    the data available from the EPA's Emissions & Generation
                    Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), we calculated the
                    grams of carbon emissions per kWh of electricity generated
                    in the United States as \[CO_2 = \frac{\bar{A}}{\bar{E}}\]
                    where \(\bar{A}\) is the annual carbon emissions in grams
                    and \(\bar{E}\) is the annual electricity generation in kWh
                    for each power plant type. We then used this data to
                    calculate the average carbon emitted per mile driven by an
                    EV in the U.S based on the average energy efficiency of
                    EVs sold in the U.S, and multiplied by the
                    <a href="https://country-level-scc.github.io/explorer/">social cost of carbon</a>
                    to obtain an estimate of the cost of carbon emissions per
                    mile driven by an EV, \(C_{EV}\).
                    \[C_{EV} = SCC * \sum_{i}CO_{2_i} * \bar{\rho}\]
                    where \(SCC\) is the social cost of carbon, \(CO_{2_i}\) is
                    the carbon emissions per kWh of electricity generated by
                    source \(i\), and \(\bar{\rho}\) is the average energy
                    efficiency of EVs sold in the U.S. Note that as the number
                    of electric vehicles on the road increases, the demand for
                    electricity will increase, and the carbon emissions per mile
                    driven by an EV will increase as well — meaning that just
                    increasing the market share of electric vehicles will result
                    in an increase in the cost of carbon emissions per mile
                    for the EVs already on the roads.
                    
                    This value may be compared with an estimate of the cost of
                    carbon emissions per mile driven by an ICE vehicle, obtained
                    by multiplying the average fuel efficiency of ICE vehicles
                    sold in the U.S by the social cost of carbon:
                    \[C_{ICE} = SCC * \bar{\mu}\]
                    where \(\bar{\mu}\) is the average fuel efficiency of ICE
                    vehicles sold in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    The results of this analysis may be seen through the
                    interactive plot below. The plot shows the cost of carbon,
                    in cents per mile, broken up by both EV/ICE, as well as per
                    energy source used to power EVs. Use the sliders at the
                    bottom to adjust the energy generation mix and the
                    percentage of EVs on the road to see how the cost of carbon
                    changes. Use the checkboxes in the energy sources legend
                    to toggle the inclusion or exclusion of different energy
                    sources in the computation. The plot is initialized with the
                    current energy generation mix and the current percentage of
                    EVs on the road in the U.S.

                <p class="indented">
                    The result of this comparison is clear. EVs are not only 
                    vastly more environmentally friendly than ICE vehicles, but
                    they also have the potential to continue to improve in
                    environmental impact as the energy generation mix in the
                    U.S is shifted towards renewable energy source. Notice that
                    well over 75% of the cost of carbon emissions for EVs comes
                    from the burning of coal. Quick maths reveal that over the
                    span of 100,000 miles, the current carbon costs of an EV
                    are just of $12,000, while the carbon costs of an ICE over
                    the same distance amount to over $750,000 — well over an
                    order of magnitude difference. While an increase in the
                    market share of EVs will increase the energy demands on the
                    power grid resulting in a higher carbon cost per mile driven
                    by EVs, the total cost of carbon emissions monotonically
                    decreases as the mix of vehicles on the roads shifts towards
                    electric.

                <p class="indented">
                    Note that this analysis has thus far used average values for
                    power efficiency and battery mineral content. In reality,
                    these values are highly variable depending on the make and 
                    model of the vehicle. To understand and visualize the
                    imporovement that can be made by switching to electric and
                    selecting the most efficient options, we created the
                    following plot which allows you to select any EV model from
                    model year 2024 and see how the cost of carbon emissions
                    from that vehicle ramps over time in comparison with the
                    average ICE.

                <p>
                    Note that while, due to the hidden carbon cost of mineral
                    mining, EVs are initially more expensive in carbon price,
                    the break even point for all vehicles (even the very least
                    environmentally friendly Hummer pickup EV), the break-even
                    point is well below the life expectancy of the vehicle. On
                    average, the break-even value is less than 50,000 miles.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Note that reflecting the true cost of carbon emissions into
                    vehicle prices for consumers now will not only incentivize
                    the purchase of less carbon-intensive vehicles, but also
                    drive the market towards a more sustainable energy
                    generation mix. Given that the social cost of carbon 
                    decreases significantly given renewable sources of energy
                    (check out the per mile costs for primarily solar and wind
                    power generation!), consumer costs could be significantly
                    reduced by a shift towards renewable energy sources. This in
                    turn could create economic and political pressure to drive
                    the energy generation mix towards renewable sources, further
                    reducing the cost of carbon emissions for all vehicles on
                    the road. While we did not model this impact here, it is
                    a clear feedback loop that could be further explored in
                    future research.

                <h2>Paying the Price</h2>
                <p>
                    This investigation has shown that the true cost of consumer
                    vehicles contains a number of different features, which may
                    be divided roughly into two categories: costs incurred in
                    the production of the vehicle, and costs incurred in the
                    operation of the vehicle. Given this, we propose two
                    strategies for charging consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices.
                </p>
                <h3>Scenario 1: Sticker Price Only</h3>
                <p>
                    The simplest way to charge consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices is to directly intervene on vehicle
                    sticker prices. The sticker price will need to reflect all 
                    relevant costs incurred during production and in ongoing
                    costs, so that the vehicle should be priced with respect to
                    expected emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle. Note
                    that this estimate will be imperfect — fuel efficiency often
                    declines as a vehicle ages — however, it is an adequate
                    first approximation.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    On this approach, then, the sticker price is 
                    \[P_{EV}=B_{EV} + \bar{L} * C_{EV}\]
                    where \(B_{EV}\) is the base price of the vehicle including
                    labor and emissions in production, \(\bar{L}\) is the
                    expected lifetime of the vehicle in miles, and \(C_{EV}\) is
                    the cost of carbon emissions per mile driven by an EV. The
                    sticker price of an ICE vehicle would be calculated in a
                    similar manner, with the base price and price of emissions
                    replaced with the base price and cost of carbon emissions
                    per mile driven by an ICE vehicle, respectively. Note that
                    \(\bar{C}\) is a dynamic value that would change as the
                    mixture of energy generation sources in the U.S changes. On
                    average, an EV would cost around $63,000, while an ICE
                    would cost about $64,500 — Note that this makes the EV the
                    <em>cheaper</em> option to buy at the dealership.
                </p>
                <img src="imgs/interv.png" alt="Price to cost comparison">
                <p>
                    Notice that this approach has both benefits and
                    disadvantages. The primary benefit of this approach is that
                    consumers would face strong incentives to purchase more
                    responsible vehicles right up front, hopefully driving the
                    market towards more sustainable electric vehicles rapidly when this
                    policy is first implemented. However, the primary
                    disadvantage is that this approach does not account for the
                    ongoing costs of operating the vehicle — some consumers will
                    be overcharged while others are undercharged, depending on
                    their driving habits and the lifetime of the vehicle.
                </p>
                <h3>Scenario 2: Cumulative Dynamic Taxes</h3>
                <p>
                    A more complex, but potentially more effective, way to
                    charge consumers the true cost of their transportation
                    choices is to intervene at two points in the vehicle
                    lifecycle: at the point of purchase, and at the point of
                    fueling. On this approach, consumers are charged the base
                    price for their vehicle including the approapriate labor and
                    emission prices in production, and then are charged a
                    tax at the point of sale for fueling the vehicle. This tax
                    would be dynamic for electric vehicles, changing as the
                    energy generation mix in the U.S changes — but static for
                    ICE vehicles, as the environmental impact of burning
                    gasoline remains stable. Seeing the plot from aboce, we
                    can understand this approach as implementing taxes in such a
                    way that the price of fueling will cause the price line to
                    follow the same slope as the cost line for vehicles over
                    time. This would be akin to around 
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    This strategy again has a number of benefits and
                    disadvantages. The primary benefit of this approach is that
                    it accounts for the ongoing costs of operating the vehicle,
                    ensuring that consumers are charged the true cost of their
                    transportation choices over the lifetime of the vehicle.
                    Along with this benefit, the tax on fueling the vehicle
                    is directly sensitive to the energy generation mix in the
                    U.S, meaning that consumers will begin to push for political
                    and corporate shifts towards sustainable energy sources to
                    reduce their own costs. However, the primary disadvantage of
                    this approach is that there is much less benefit for
                    consumers at the point of sale of the vehicle to select for
                    electric. This could slow the adoption of electric vehicles
                    in the short term, as consumers are less incentivized to
                    purchase electric vehicles right up front if they are
                    unaware of the long-term benefit of doing so.

                <h2>The Upshot</h2>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the true cost of consumer vehicles includes
                    a number of different features, which may be divided
                    roughly into two categories: costs incurred in the
                    production of the vehicle, and costs incurred in the
                    operation of the vehicle. We have shown that the true cost
                    of electric vehicles is significantly lower than that of
                    ICE vehicles even when accounting for the labor costs of cobalt
                    mining and the environmental costs of carbon emissions.
                    This analysis has focused only on lightweight passenger
                    vehicles, but a similar analysis should be extended to heavy
                    duty vehicles as well as to other types of vehicles - hybrids,
                    diesel, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We have proposed two
                    different strategies for charging consumers the true cost of
                    their transportation choices, one based on a static sticker
                    price and the other based on a dynamic tax on fueling. Both
                    show significant promise in incentivizing the purchase of
                    more sustainable vehicles, and further research should be
                    conducted to explore the potential impacts of these policies
                    on consumer behavior and the market for electric vehicles.
