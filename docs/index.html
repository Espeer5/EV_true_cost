                    Electric vehicles (EVs) have seen massive increases in
                    sales, news coverage, political importance, and regulatory
                    attention as the worrying effects of climate change due to
                    CO2 emissions become abundantly clear. Adoption of this
                    “green” alternative to traditional internal combustion
                    engine (ICE) vehicles is sold as the most climate-friendly
                    option. However, there are hidden aspects of the production
                    process of the lithium-ion batteries required for EVs and
                    the carbon emissions of the energy generation methods that
                    power EVs. In an effort to understand the full social and
                    environmental impact of the electrification of
                    transportation, we have conducted an investigative data
                    analysis to determine the true cost of electric vehicles,
                    compare that cost to the cost of ICE vehicles, and explore
                    strategies for charging consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices.

                    In this article, we will build up the true cost of EVs by
                    exploring the different components that contribute to the
                    social and environmental costs of EVs. We will first
                    investigate the human labor and mining costs of cobalt, the
                    primary mineral used in lithium-ion batteries. To determine
                    the human costs, we will look at the direct and downstream
                    costs of labor of mineral/metal mining for batteries
                    required in electric vehicles as compared to those for ICE
                    cars. We will then investigate the carbon emissions of the
                    energy generation methods that power EVs and compare them
                    to the carbon emissions of burning gasoline. Finally, we
                    will explore strategies for charging consumers the true
                    cost of their transportation choices, including direct
                    intervention on vehicle sticker prices as well as cumulative
                    carbon tax policies.

                <h2>The Cost of Carbon Emissions</h2>
                <p>
                    CO2 emissions are the primary environmental concern for the
                    transportation industry. ICE vehicles have long been 
                    criticized for their high carbon emissions due to the direct
                    burning of gasoline. However, the carbon emissions of the
                    energy generation methods that power EVs are often ignored.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    In order to dig deeper into the climate impact of EVs, we
                    first assesed the current state of the energy generation
                    methods used to power EVs in the United States. Drawing on
                    the data available from the EPA's Emissions & Generation
                    Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), we calculated the
                    carbon emissions per kWh of electricity generated in the
                    United States, as well as the potential emissions for a
                    range of different energy generation scenarios. We then used
                    this data to calculate the average carbon emitted per mile
                    driven by an EV in the U.S based on the average energy
                    efficiency of EVs sold in the U.S, and multiplied by the
                    <a href="https://country-level-scc.github.io/explorer/">social cost of carbon</a>
                    to obtain an estimate of the cost of carbon emissions per
                    mile driven by an EV. This value may be compared with an
                    estimate of the cost of carbon emissions per mile driven by
                    an ICE vehicle, obtained by multiplying the average fuel
                    efficiency of ICE vehicles sold in the U.S by the social
                    cost of carbon.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    The results of this analysis may be seen through the
                    interactive plot below. The plot shows the cost of carbon,
                    in cents per mile, broken up by both EV/ICE, as well as per
                    energy source used to power EVs. Use the sliders at the
                    bottom to adjust the energy generation mix and the
                    percentage of EVs on the road to see how the cost of carbon
                    changes. Use the checkboxes in the energy sources legend
                    to toggle the inclusion or exclusion of different energy
                    sources in the computation. The plot is initialized with the
                    current energy generation mix and the current percentage of
                    EVs on the road in the U.S.

                <p class="indented">
                    The result of this comparison is clear. EVs are not only 
                    vastly more environmentally friendly than ICE vehicles, but
                    they also have the potential to continue to improve in
                    environmental impact as the energy generation mix in the
                    U.S is shifted towards renewable energy source. Notice that
                    well over 75% of the cost of carbon emissions for EVs comes
                    from the burning of coal. Quick maths reveal that over the
                    span of 100,000 miles, the current carbon costs of an EV
                    are just of $12,000, while the carbon costs of an ICE over
                    the same distance amount to over $750,000 — well over an
                    order of magnitude difference. While an increase in the
                    market share of EVs will increase the energy demands on the
                    power grid resulting in a higher carbon cost per mile driven
                    by EVs, the total cost of carbon emissions monotonically
                    decreases as the mix of vehicles on the roads shifts towards
                    electric.
