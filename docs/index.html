                    Electric vehicles (EVs) have seen massive increases in
                    sales, news coverage, political importance, and regulatory
                    attention as the worrying effects of climate change due to
                    CO2 emissions become abundantly clear. Adoption of this
                    “green” alternative to traditional internal combustion
                    engine (ICE) vehicles is sold as the most climate-friendly
                    option. However, there are hidden aspects of the production
                    process of the lithium-ion batteries required for EVs and
                    the carbon emissions of the energy generation methods that
                    power EVs. In an effort to understand the full social and
                    environmental impact of the electrification of
                    transportation, we have conducted an investigative data
                    analysis to determine the true cost of electric vehicles,
                    compare that cost to the cost of ICE vehicles, and explore
                    strategies for charging consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices.

                    In this article, we will build up the true cost of EVs by
                    exploring the different components that contribute to the
                    social and environmental costs of EVs. We will first
                    investigate the human labor and mining costs of cobalt, the
                    primary mineral used in lithium-ion batteries. To determine
                    the human costs, we will look at the direct and downstream
                    costs of labor of mineral/metal mining for batteries
                    required in electric vehicles as compared to those for ICE
                    cars. We will then investigate the carbon emissions of the
                    energy generation methods that power EVs and compare them
                    to the carbon emissions of burning gasoline. Finally, we
                    will explore strategies for charging consumers the true
                    cost of their transportation choices, including direct
                    intervention on vehicle sticker prices as well as cumulative
                    carbon tax policies.

                <p>
                    We will first investigate the human labor and mining costs
                    of cobalt, the primary mineral used in lithium-ion
                    batteries. To determine the human costs, we will look at the
                    direct and downstream costs of labor of mineral/metal mining
                    for batteries required in electric vehicles as compared to
                    those for ICE cars.

                    The most important component of an EV is its battery.
                    However, the materials required for these batteries come
                    with a cost. 60% of the world’s Cobalt comes from the
                    Democratic Republic of the Congo, where there are constant
                    questions of worker abuse, human rights abuse, and child
                    labor. We note that the majority of workers in the Congolese
                    mines are indirect hires rather than direct hires, meaning
                    that they are not afforded the same benefits and
                    protections. We further analyze what it would cost to pay
                    these workers a fair wage.

                    The difference in the number of indirect hires vs. direct
                    hires in the Congolese mines is stark. Based on the following
                    data, we can see that the majority of workers in the
                    Congolese mines are indirect hires, meaning that indirect
                    hiring is a route used to circumnavigate paying workers the
                    benefits they deserve.

                    Mining for batteries also pose a deep threat for the
                    surrounding environment, which in turn affects its
                    inhabitants. Mining raw materials requires harsh chemicals
                    and large amounts of water, often in areas where water is
                    already scarce. Additionally, heat between 800 and 1,000C is
                    needed, which requires the burning of fossil fuels.
                    These harms posed to the water supply and environment hurt
                    the agricultural industry nearby.  In an article in the
                    National Library of Medicine, researchers talk to farmers in
                    the Katangese Copperbelt in Central Africa, noting their
                    struggle to obtain compensation for the costs of nearby
                    mining. In this area, many farmers note the decrease in
                    water quality. Specifically, between 2013 and 2014, they
                    note the death of fish in the nearby river, and increased
                    crop failure. The polluters have not responded to these
                    concerns, however, 88% of the farmers interviewed voiced a
                    need for the depollution of their area. They further state
                    that they would accept, if offered, a compensation of $US
                    2820 per farmer.

                    Outside of the human costs of mining cobalt, there are also
                    associated environmental costs. For example, the Tesla Model
                    3 holds an 80 kWh lithium-ion battery. Research[?] concludes
                    that mining the materials for this battery would result in
                    between 2,400kg and 16,000kg of CO2 emissions. This is
                    between 1.5 and 1.6 metric tons. For context, one ton of CO2
                    is about the amount that a typical gas-powered car emits in
                    about 2,500 miles of driving. Using the social cost of
                    carbon, which we will explore below in the context of
                    electricity generation, we can estimate the cost of these
                    emissions to be around $295.

                <h2>The Cost of Carbon Emissions</h2>
                <p>
                    CO2 emissions are the primary environmental concern for the
                    transportation industry. ICE vehicles have long been 
                    criticized for their high carbon emissions due to the direct
                    burning of gasoline. However, the carbon emissions of the
                    energy generation methods that power EVs are often ignored.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    In order to dig deeper into the climate impact of EVs, we
                    first assesed the current state of the energy generation
                    methods used to power EVs in the United States. Drawing on
                    the data available from the EPA's Emissions & Generation
                    Resource Integrated Database (eGRID), we calculated the
                    grams of carbon emissions per kWh of electricity generated
                    in the United States as \[CO_2 = \frac{\bar{A}}{\bar{E}}\]
                    where \(\bar{A}\) is the annual carbon emissions in grams
                    and \(\bar{E}\) is the annual electricity generation in kWh
                    for each power plant type. We then used this data to
                    calculate the average carbon emitted per mile driven by an
                    EV in the U.S based on the average energy efficiency of
                    EVs sold in the U.S, and multiplied by the
                    <a href="https://country-level-scc.github.io/explorer/">social cost of carbon</a>
                    to obtain an estimate of the cost of carbon emissions per
                    mile driven by an EV, \(C_{EV}\).
                    \[C_{EV} = SCC * \sum_{i}CO_{2_i} * \bar{\rho}\]
                    where \(SCC\) is the social cost of carbon, \(CO_{2_i}\) is
                    the carbon emissions per kWh of electricity generated by
                    source \(i\), and \(\bar{\rho}\) is the average energy
                    efficiency of EVs sold in the U.S. Note that as the number
                    of electric vehicles on the road increases, the demand for
                    electricity will increase, and the carbon emissions per mile
                    driven by an EV will increase as well — meaning that just
                    increasing the market share of electric vehicles will result
                    in an increase in the cost of carbon emissions per mile
                    for the EVs already on the roads.
                    
                    This value may be compared with an estimate of the cost of
                    carbon emissions per mile driven by an ICE vehicle, obtained
                    by multiplying the average fuel efficiency of ICE vehicles
                    sold in the U.S by the social cost of carbon:
                    \[C_{ICE} = SCC * \bar{\mu}\]
                    where \(\bar{\mu}\) is the average fuel efficiency of ICE
                    vehicles sold in the U.S.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    The results of this analysis may be seen through the
                    interactive plot below. The plot shows the cost of carbon,
                    in cents per mile, broken up by both EV/ICE, as well as per
                    energy source used to power EVs. Use the sliders at the
                    bottom to adjust the energy generation mix and the
                    percentage of EVs on the road to see how the cost of carbon
                    changes. Use the checkboxes in the energy sources legend
                    to toggle the inclusion or exclusion of different energy
                    sources in the computation. The plot is initialized with the
                    current energy generation mix and the current percentage of
                    EVs on the road in the U.S.

                <p class="indented">
                    The result of this comparison is clear. EVs are not only 
                    vastly more environmentally friendly than ICE vehicles, but
                    they also have the potential to continue to improve in
                    environmental impact as the energy generation mix in the
                    U.S is shifted towards renewable energy source. Notice that
                    well over 75% of the cost of carbon emissions for EVs comes
                    from the burning of coal. Quick maths reveal that over the
                    span of 100,000 miles, the current carbon costs of an EV
                    are just of $12,000, while the carbon costs of an ICE over
                    the same distance amount to over $750,000 — well over an
                    order of magnitude difference. While an increase in the
                    market share of EVs will increase the energy demands on the
                    power grid resulting in a higher carbon cost per mile driven
                    by EVs, the total cost of carbon emissions monotonically
                    decreases as the mix of vehicles on the roads shifts towards
                    electric.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Note that reflecting the true cost of carbon emissions into
                    vehicle prices for consumers now will not only incentivize
                    the purchase of less carbon-intensive vehicles, but also
                    drive the market towards a more sustainable energy
                    generation mix. Given that the social cost of carbon 
                    decreases significantly given renewable sources of energy
                    (check out the per mile costs for primarily solar and wind
                    power generation!), consumer costs could be significantly
                    reduced by a shift towards renewable energy sources. This in
                    turn could create economic and political pressure to drive
                    the energy generation mix towards renewable sources, further
                    reducing the cost of carbon emissions for all vehicles on
                    the road. While we did not model this impact here, it is
                    a clear feedback loop that could be further explored in
                    future research.

                <h2>Paying the Price</h2>
                <p>
                    This investigation has shown that the true cost of consumer
                    vehicles contains a number of different features, which may
                    be divided roughly into two categories: costs incurred in
                    the production of the vehicle, and costs incurred in the
                    operation of the vehicle. Given this, we propose two
                    strategies for charging consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices.
                </p>
                <h3>Scenario 1: Sticker Price Only</h3>
                <p>
                    The simplest way to charge consumers the true cost of their
                    transportation choices is to directly intervene on vehicle
                    sticker prices. The sticker price will need to reflect all 
                    relevant costs incurred during production and in ongoing
                    costs, so that the vehicle should be priced with respect to
                    expected emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle. Note
                    that this estimate will be imperfect — fuel efficiency often
                    declines as a vehicle ages — however, it is an adequate
                    first approximation.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    On this approach, then, the sticker price is 
                    \[P_{EV}=B_{EV} + \bar{L} * C_{EV}\]
                    where \(B_{EV}\) is the base price of the vehicle including
                    labor and emissions in production, \(\bar{L}\) is the
                    expected lifetime of the vehicle in miles, and \(C_{EV}\) is
                    the cost of carbon emissions per mile driven by an EV. The
                    sticker price of an ICE vehicle would be calculated in a
                    similar manner, with the base price and price of emissions
                    replaced with the base price and cost of carbon emissions
                    per mile driven by an ICE vehicle, respectively. Note that
                    \(\bar{C}\) is a dynamic value that would change as the
                    mixture of energy generation sources in the U.S changes.
                </p>
                <p>TODO: PLOT OF PRICE TO COST WITH LABOR DATA</p>
                <p>
                    Notice that this approach has both benefits and
                    disadvantages. The primary benefit of this approach is that
                    consumers would face string incentives to purchase more
                    responsible vehicles right up front, hopefully driving the
                    market towards more sustainable vehicles rapidly when this
                    policy is first implemented. However, the primary
                    disadvantage is that this approach does not account for the
                    ongoing costs of operating the vehicle — some consumers will
                    be overcharged while others are undercharged, depending on
                    their driving habits and the lifetime of the vehicle.

                <h3>Scenario 2: Cumulative Dynamic Taxes</h3>
                <p>
                    A more complex, but potentially more effective, way to
                    charge consumers the true cost of their transportation
                    choices is to intervene at two points in the vehicle
                    lifecycle: at the point of purchase, and at the point of
                    fueling. On this approach, consumers are charged the base
                    price for their vehicle including the approapriate labor and
                    emission prices in production, and then are charged a
                    tax at the point of sale for fueling the vehicle. This tax
                    would be dynamic for electric vehicles, changing as the
                    energy generation mix in the U.S changes — but static for
                    ICE vehicles, as the environmental impact of burning
                    gasoline remains stable.

                    This strategy again has a number of benefits and
                    disadvantages. The primary benefit of this approach is that
                    it accounts for the ongoing costs of operating the vehicle,
                    ensuring that consumers are charged the true cost of their
                    transportation choices over the lifetime of the vehicle.
                    Along with this benefit, the tax on fueling the vehicle
                    is directly sensitive to the energy generation mix in the
                    U.S, meaning that consumers will begin to push for political
                    and corporate shifts towards sustainable energy sources to
                    reduce their own costs. However, the primary disadvantage of
                    this approach is that there is much less benefit for
                    consumers at the point of sale of the vehicle to select for
                    electric. This could slow the adoption of electric vehicles
                    in the short term, as consumers are less incentivized to
                    purchase electric vehicles right up front if they are
                    unaware of the long-term benefit of doing so.
